            2.  "headers-only"  Not all blocks for this branch are available, but the headers are valid
            3.  "valid-headers" All blocks are available for this branch, but they were never fully validated
            4.  "valid-fork"    This branch is not part of the active chain, but is fully validated
            5.  "active"        This is the tip of the active main chain, which is certainly valid
