Bitcoin Core's http RPC interface enforces ["basic access authentication"][1] for all requests; each http request must include an `Authorization` header whose value is `Basic abc123` where `abc123` is the [base64 encoding][2] of the string `username:password` where `username` and `password` are an RPC username and password.

Refer to your http client's documentation to determine how to attach an `Authorization` header, but for example with the popular command-line utility, [cURL][3], the syntax is:

    curl localhost:18332 --user 'username:password' --data '{"method": "getnetworkinfo"}'

On the server side, prior to version 0.12 the Bitcoin Core server administrator had to specify the username and password on startup as the configuration parameters `rpcuser` and `rpcpassword`, respectively. Starting in version 0.12, those parameters are deprecated. Instead, the administrator can provide one or more `rpcauth` values

The first thing to clarify is that "cookie"-based authentication is a misnomer because it doesn't actually use http "cookies" as defined by [Wikipedia][4], [Mozilla][5]. In fact, "cookie"-based simply contains a string of the form `__cookie__:f2d9055a243` where `__cookie__` is the "rpcuser" and `f2d9055a243` is the
